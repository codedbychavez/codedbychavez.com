Not too long ago I was interviewed by two companies for frontend developer posts.  Even though I passed the technical interviews at both companies I was still convinced that I wasn't that good on certain topics in JavaScript. During my interview, there were some questions I wished I had answered differently.

I went on a Google search quest to find some kind of resource I can use to supplement the gaps, but not long after I came across this site called freeCodeCamp (https://freecodecamp.com) and took a look at the curriculums they were offering in the web development space and I found (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

## Me Vs. freeCodeCamp

I started with basic JavaScript; the first section of the challenge.  It consisted of 113 lessons on the core fundamentals of JavaScript (See the entire curriculum here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

### Interactive Challenges

To ensure that you applied what you learned in a lesson you are required to use/ implement what you have learned to solve a challenge.  Downside? well, there isn't any in my opinion but you can't move on to the next lesson until your solution to the coding challenges is correct. The solution that you came up with is validated against predefined test cases on the freeCodeCamp platform.

### Are there helpful Hints?

Yes, If you ever get stuck there are hints that you can access by clicking the Get Help button on the lower left.

## My Final takeaways

For many of the lessons, the way they were communicating a piece of code broaden my outlook on how JavaScript code works and shed light on new ways to problem-solve. I can slowly feel those gaps in my knowledge of JavaScript are filling as I continue.

## Why I would recommend it (as a Software Engineer)

Yes, It's really cool that these valuable lessons are available for free. You won't regret it!
